 <li>Write a Python function that takes as input a FASTA file and returns a sequence string [2pt].</li>

 <li>Write a Python function that takes as input a sequence string and returns a list with 4 entries that are the number of A, C, G, and T in the sequence [2pt].</li>

 <li>Write a Python function that takes two inputs: a sequence string and a string of two letters (e.g., “CG” or “CT”). This function returns the number of times the two letters occur consecutively in the sequence [2pt].</li>

 <li>Explore the NCBI website, go to the following two pages, and download the FASTA files for the human gene <em>PTPN11</em> and it’s <em>Drosophila</em> orthologue <em>csw</em>.</li>

For each of the two FASTA files, print the output of function #2 and function #3 with input “CG”. Compare the results and describe your finding [2pt].

<ol start="5">

 <li>[Bonus] Write another Python function that takes as input a sequence string and returns a list with 16 entries that are the outputs of function #3 for all 16 possible two letter strings [Bonus 1 pt].</li>

Turn in the code for the three (or four) Python functions and the answer for question #4 into one file in Jupyter Notebook format (.ipynb). Use the “Turnitin” link on Blackboard/Assignments/Assignment 1 to submit this file.
